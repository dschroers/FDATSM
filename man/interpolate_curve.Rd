\title{Interpolate Discount Curve}
\usage{
interpolate_curve(maturities, prices, day_grid)
}
\arguments{
\item{maturities}{Numeric vector of observed maturities (e.g., in days or years).}

\item{prices}{Numeric vector of observed discount prices corresponding to the maturities.}

\item{day_grid}{Numeric vector representing the time grid to evaluate the interpolated curve on (e.g., 1:3650 for 10 years).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of interpolated discount prices evaluated at \code{day_grid}.
}
\description{
Interpolates a discount curve to daily resolution using natural splines.
A value of 1 at time 0 is enforced for consistency with discount factor properties.
}
\examples{
maturities <- c(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 30)
prices <- c(0.99, 0.975, 0.958, 0.93, 0.905, 0.88, 0.85, 0.83, 0.80)
day_grid <- seq(0, 30, length.out = 300)  # extrapolation at 0
curve <- interpolate_curve(maturities = maturities, prices = prices, day_grid = day_grid)
plot(x = day_grid, y = curve, type = "l", main = "Interpolated Discount Curve")
