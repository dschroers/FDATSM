Description: Description: Provides tools for analyzing realized covariations of difference returns and the term structure of volatility in bond markets, as introduced in "Dynamically Consistent Analysis of Realized Covariations in Term Structure Models" (Schroers, 2024). Designed for use with daily yield or discount curve data, the package enables robust estimation of the covolatility kernel of instantaneous forward curves. Includes methods for preprocessing real-world bond market data, handling incomplete maturity grids, and detecting jumps in volatility.
