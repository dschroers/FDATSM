# FDATSM

<!-- badges: start -->
The R package `FDATSM` enables quantitative analysis of covariations of difference returns as described in the articles [**Dynamically Consistent Analysis of Realized Covariations in Term Structure Models**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19412) by [Dennis Schroers](https://github.com/dschroers). The data inputs should be yield or discount data over over a prespecified time span (e.g. a quarter, a year, a decade) and an upper limit on the time to maturity (e.g. 5 years, 10 years, 30 years). The resolution of the data in time and time to maturity should coincide (e.g. if data are available daily, the corresponding yields or zero-coupon bond prices must be available in a daily resolution in the maturity dimension). For the important case of daily data, this necessitates smoothed discount or yield curves. In the example presented below, we use data from ... and ... .  
The estimated covariations of difference returns correspond to rescaled empirical covariances of difference returns and are provided in matrix format. A jump truncation method is also available, corresponding to an outlier robust estimator for the covariations.

## Installation

You can install the development version of FDATSM from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dschroers/FDASPDE")
```

## Simple Example with Simulated Data
Subsequently, a simple example for the analysis of covariations in the bond market is presented:

```{r example}
library(FDATSM)
library(pracma)
library(MASS)
library(matrixcalc)
## basic example code
```

The subsequent code generates samples difference returns in resolution $n\times n$ (time and time to maturity)  generated from instantaneous forward curve model 

```math 
df_t = \partial_x f_t dt+ dX_t
```

where 

```math 
X_t=  W_t^Q+ J_t
```

where $W^Q$ is a $Q$-Wiener process for a covariance operator $Q$ given by an integral kernel operator with integral kernel $q\in L^2([0,1]^2)$ taking the Gaussian form

```math
q(x,y)= \exp(-10 (x-y)^2),
```

which can be plotted:

```{r}
q<-Gaussian.cov(10,100,100)
persp(z=  q[1:100,1:100],xlab= "Time to maturity (years)", zlab = "", ylab = "")
```

The jump process $J$ is a compound Poisson process in $L^2(0,1)$ and is given as 

```math
J_t = \sum_{i=1}^{N_t}\chi_i,
```
where $N$ is a Poisson process with intensity $\lambda>0$ and jumps $\chi\sim(N(0,C))$ for a covariance operator $C$ in $L^2(0,1)$ given as an integral kernel operator via the kernel 

```math
c(x,y)\propto \exp(-x)\exp(-y)
```

such that $\|c\|_{L^2([0,1]^2)}=1$.

which can be plotted:

```{r}
k<-10*Exponential.cov(100,100)
persp(z=k[1:100,1:200],xlab= "Time to maturity (years)")
```



```{r}
set.seed(123)
SIM<-Simulator(100,100, q= q, k=k, f0=numeric(201))
```

Now use the Truncated estimator to estimate the volatility

```{r}
Est<-Truncated.Covariation.estimator(x=SIM$Prices)
```

The relative MSE in Hilbert-Schmidt norm is 

```{r}
L2.HS.norm(Est$IV-q[1:99,1:99]/100)/L2.HS.norm(q[1:99,1:99]/100)
```
The measured number of factors to explain 99% of the variation in the data is 

```{r}
which.max(Est$expl.var >.99)
```
which is the correct number of factors needed to explain 99% of the variation:
```{r}
loads<-numeric(ncol(q[1:99,1:99]))
    EG<-eigen(q[1:99,1:99])
    for (i in 1:ncol(q[1:99,1:99])) {
      loads[i]<-sum(EG$values[1:i])
    }
    expl.var<-loads/sum(EG$values)
which.max(expl.var >.99)
```

The detected jump locations are
```{r}
Est$locs
```
while the correct jump locations are
```{r}
SIM$jump.locs
```
